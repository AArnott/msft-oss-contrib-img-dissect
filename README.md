# Faces of Microsoft Open Source Contributions
## The Photo

This photo was put together to give a face to the many Microsoft contributors to open source software. It was [presented by Julia White at Red Hat Summit](https://twitter.com/julwhite), and a [full video of just the testimonials](https://youtu.be/4EYseGkkk_c) is also available.

I first saw this photo posted as a [tweet from OSCON3017](https://twitter.com/reid24hrs/status/862346968781271040) from [@reid24hrs](https://twitter.com/reid24hrs/). I asked if anyone had a better copy, and [Reid came through again](https://twitter.com/reid24hrs/status/862749470752215044).

After some back-and-forth, the original creator, [Jos√© Miguel Parrella](https://twitter.com/bureado/) [gave us permission to use it here](https://twitter.com/bureado/status/863071576421392384) (and even provided me with an even [larger version](original-github-avatar-collage.png) that was slightly reduced for web use).
